   //   ( tag you want to create  ,  object  ,  Content we want to inject inside the tag)

    // Step 2 ) Create react element ( Here since we want to render or inject the data or element into the root element so therefore we are manipulating the DOM structure so therefore we need reactDOM

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot( document.getElementById('root') ) ;

    // root => The route is created inside the react , In the root all the react codes , injected codes will be run
    
    // Step 3 ) Now render or inject the heading tag inside the root element

    <!-- If there is nothing inside the div tag , then automatically the script tag will be printed , else if there is something inside the script tag , then the render() inside script tag will ( override or replace it , not append ) print in the website render() -->

    <!-- Refresh the page very fast -->

    <!-- So here the compiler will read the HTML code line by line and will print the div tag content in present in the HTML page as soon as it reaches the script tag So it will load react , reactDOM in our app And when it reaches app.js and render() So it will include all the object inside my root element present in the html page -->

    <!-- Here hello from top and hello from bottom h1 tags will not be rendered , Because react is applied only to the div tag -->

<!-- If we put app.js script above the two react cdn links then it will throw error => React is not defined
Therefore we have to maintain the order of the cdn links as well as the App.js , Because our app.js file is using the react and react dom therefore we have to maintain the 

Q ) what is cross origin in React CDN links ?

Ans )In easy terms, CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is like a handshake between your website and CDN (could be other servers as well), saying it's okay to load resources from each other. It acts as a security check to prevent malicious scripts from loading unauthorized resources. -->
